== Installation ==

1. Upload the zip on the Plugins > Add screen in wp-admin

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Go to Settings -> BP Simple Events and enter your Google Maps API Key. If you don't have a Key - See the FAQ


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Google Maps API Key?
Yes, if you select to use that option. If you need help, read this tutorial [Google Maps API Key](https://www.philopress.com/google-maps-api-key/ "Google Maps API Key")

= I created a future event but it shows only in Archive folder =
This is due to a difference between English and European preference re date format.

The fix is simple.
Open this file in a text editor:
bp-simple-events-pro/inc/js/events.js

Find: dateFormat: 'DD, MM d, yy'

For Europe, change it to: dateFormat: 'dd-mm-yy'  Or whatever you prefer

You will then need to :
* upload the edited events.js file
* clear your browser cache ( just the files ) to insure that the js file reloads
* edit any existing Events and reset the date

= MultiSite support? =

No.

= Calendar support? =

Yes - if the Calendar supports assigning custom post types


= Can I remove the option to assign a Category ? =

Yes, by using the filter hook.
Place this function in your theme > functions.php
`
	function pp_events_category_filter( $args ) {
		$args = array( "child_of" => -1 );
		return $args;
	}
	add_filter( "event_cat_args_filter", "pp_events_category_filter", 1, 1 );
`
